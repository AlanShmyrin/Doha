Hi I'm alan
---------------------------------
it's app use mysql database for monitoring Personal computers in small companies.
maybe in later project get updates, 'cause this need more protection.
---------------------------------------------------
database have not data, so you need add user for sing in app.
user have two levels access, there are 1(admin) and 0(regular client/user). (code 2 - error in check method)
---------------------------------------------------
for import database just use tool "mysql.exe" and file "dump_audit_nodata.sql".
----------------------------------------------------

Thanks you :3
